# SIP Call Classifier & Anomaly Detection

This project was undertaken as a learning exercise to explore the application of Machine Learning and Natural Language Processing (NLP) to Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) logs. The primary goal was to build a model capable of classifying different types of SIP call events (e.g., normal calls, call failures) and to investigate its potential for anomaly detection.
